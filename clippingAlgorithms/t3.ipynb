    "The Cyrus-Beck algorithm is a line clipping algorithm that can be used to determine the portion of a line that lies within a specified boundary. In Python, you can implement this algorithm using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define the boundary of the clip window as a list of points in the form [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)].\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define the line to be clipped as a pair of points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each edge of the clip window, compute the normal vector to the edge. The normal vector is a vector that is perpendicular to the edge and points outward from the clip window.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each normal vector, compute the dot product between the normal vector and the vector representing the line. If the dot product is positive, the line is outside the clip window for that edge. If the dot product is negative, the line is inside the clip window for that edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the line is outside the clip window for any edge, clip the line at that edge using the intersection point between the line and the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Repeat steps 3-5 for each edge of the clip window until the line is completely within the clip window or there are no more edges to consider."
